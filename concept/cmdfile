!cdav!
# !cdav! is needed for cdav to execute the file. If not found the file won't be executed.

# Some general information 
# The cdav file will contain a definition of commands that will be executed.
# Each command block can have at least all the arguments that can be passed to cdav when executed by itself on the CLI.
# Additionally there are arguments that can be used to determine the execution behaviour for the file.

# You can specify variables in a special block called VAR.
# They can be accessed in a "Makefile-manner".

VAR
{
	user=somedude
	password=verysecret
}

# This is how a command block looks like

	# To specify parallel execution of blocks the "parallel-level" can be used to specify the order and parallelity of block execution.
