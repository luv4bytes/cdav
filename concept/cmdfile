!cdav!
# !cdav! is needed for cdav to execute the file. If not found the file won't be executed.

# Some general information 
# The cdav file will contain a definition of commands that will be executed.
# Each command block can have at least all the arguments that can be passed to cdav when executed by itself on the CLI.
# Additionally there are arguments that can be used to determine the execution behaviour for the file.

# You can specify variables in a special block called VAR.
# They can be accessed in a "Makefile-manner".

# Every assignment needs to end on a semicolon.

VAR
{
	user="somed#ude";
	password=verysecret;
}

# This is how a command block looks like
# The properties of a command block are named after the long names of the arguments.
